## NameError: name 'ok' is not defined

If you get an error
```
NameError: name 'ok' is not defined
```

**Solution**: run the code cell that says `from client.api.notebook import Notebook` in it (in Lab01 this cell is in section `1.5 Submitting your work`). You will need to run this cell _every time_ you start a new session.
