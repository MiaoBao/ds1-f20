Nothing will be due this week! We are currently continuing to enroll students and are issuing add codes on an individual basis.

Our first lab will be this **Wednesday (Oct 7)** via the same Zoom link as the lecture.
The link to Lab01 will be posted on the [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule) page.

The labs will always be due _the following Wednesday_, so you'll have a week to finish the lab.
Lab attendance is highly encouraged; if you have a conflict with the section that you are enrolled in,
you can join the other section instead.

Everyone will be added to Piazza and Gradescope on **Friday (Oct 9)**. 
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
